## üîß Key Features Implementation

### SQLite Database
- **Database Service**: Centralized database operations
- **Task Schema**: ID, title, description, timestamps, completion status
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Search Functionality**: Search tasks by title or description

### Redux State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with less boilerplate
- **Tasks Slice**: Manages task state and actions
- **Typed Hooks**: Type-safe Redux hooks
- **Async Operations**: Handles database operations with loading states

### Push Notifications
- **Expo Notifications**: Cross-platform notification handling
- **Permission Management**: Request and handle notification permissions
- **Notification Listeners**: Handle received and response notifications
- **Test Notifications**: Built-in test notification functionality

### Form Validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate inputs as user types
- **Error Handling**: Display validation errors with helpful messages
- **Character Limits**: Enforce title and description length limits
- **Required Fields**: Ensure required fields are filled

## üé® UI/UX Features

- **Clean Design**: Modern, intuitive interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh task list by pulling down
- **Search**: Real-time search with clear functionality
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no tasks exist

## üîç Search & Filter

- **Real-time Search**: Search tasks as you type
- **Case-insensitive**: Search works regardless of case

### Database Configuration
The SQLite database is automatically initialized when the app starts. The database file is stored locally on the device.

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **SQLite**: Fast local database operations
- **Redux**: Efficient state management with minimal re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of listeners and subscriptions
